# Finger_Guns

Do you like shooting people? Of course you do!

In this game, a bunch of guys are coming at you, and you need to shoot them before they reach you.

But here's the interesting part: no mouse and keyboard, you shoot with your hand!

You can aim at the screen with a finger gun, shoot with your thumb!

You'll need to hit every enemy enough times before they reach the bottom of the screen; if one does, you'll lose 1 HP, and if those reach 0, you'll lose!

Your objective is to kill 30 enemies before you run out of HP.

But be careful: the enemies are not just going to stand there, they can dodge!
They are able to shift their head and torso, to make it more difficult for you to shoot them.
Don't get deceived by these tactics!

A shot to the head is an instant kill, but three torso shots are required to take an enemy down; you can also aim for the legs, that do not shift, but that requires five shots for a kill.

The scope does not move when you are shooting, so don't be too trigger happy and make every shot count.
Also, your gun is not a Gatling, so you'll have to raise your thumb every time you want to shoot again.

Finally, some tips:
1. the scope position is tracked using the tip of your index finger, so focus on that if you have problems aiming
2. the trigger is considered pulled when your thumb tip is under the first thumb phalanx, so try to keep your thumb as straight as possible when not shooting, and contract it as much as you can when shooting

At the end, you will be able to see your score and compare it to the high scores!
